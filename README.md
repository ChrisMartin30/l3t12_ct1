Followed steps of Compulsory Task 1 from Level 3, Task 12 of HyperionDev Software Engineering bootcamp.

The task is as shown below.

Follow these steps:
* Create a file called semantic.py and run all the code extracts above.
* Write a note about what you found interesting about the similarities
between cat, monkey and banana and think of an example of your own.
* Run the example file with the simpler language model ‘en_core_web_sm’
and write a note on what you notice is different from the model
'en_core_web_md'.
* Host your solution on a Git host such as GitLab or GitHub with a Dockerfile

  * If it doesn’t already, please ensure that your repo includes a file
named requirements.txt to automate the installation of the project’s
